# Below you'll find an example configuration, showing you and explaining most
# (if not all) possible configurations you might need. If you are unsure about

# Each of the sections in this file matches to a struct under the same name,
# and every struct field contains some documentation that might help you out.

[initialization]
# The initialization table allows you to define some basic rules that you want
# added to the IPv4 or IPv6 iptables, in addition to the rules generated by
# DFW.

[initialization.v4]
# The key-name identifies the iptables table you want to add the rules to (i.e.
# `filter`, `nat`, `mangle` or even `raw`). The value should be a list of
# strings, where each string is an iptables rule you want added.
